in the beans.xml bean definitions we can set, either globally or per bean; init- and destruct- methods
however, it is generally considered to be best practice to use the JSR250 post-construct and pre-destroy annotations

we do this by declaring a bean with the common annotation bean-post-processor.

(we can add an init-method="x" property to each <bean> tag, or globally in <beans> .... but no.)

** this is done with a post-processor-specific bean and a new dependency in the pom.xml
bean: <bean class="org.springframework.context.annotation.CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor"/>
pom: javax.annotation-api  (this goes in the parent pom for multi-module, then in each pom that needs it)

-- which now allows us to add the tag directly to our .java class;    @PostConstruct
