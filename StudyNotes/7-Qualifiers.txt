When attempting dependency injection of primitives, you can use @Bean annotation, but the parent field name
must match the @Bean method name, which must match the field name in the class which has the dependency...
- this is obviously prone to bugs on refactor/renaming... so we use qualifiers instead:

this is also known as: fine-tuning annotation-based autowiring

e.g. MaxNumber.java:
package xx;
import xx;
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.METHOD})
^^ this means where can I use my annotation... any Field, Parameter or Method
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
^^ lifespan of this annotation... RUNTIME
@Qualifier
^^ spring annotation,
public @interface MaxNumber {

}
