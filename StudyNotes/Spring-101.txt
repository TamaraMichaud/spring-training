SPRING CONTAINER = spring IoC container = Inversion of Control container...
^ is a component of the spring framework which contains the "Beans"
  and manages their complete lifecycle.

A Bean is a simple java object, which is instantiated, assembled and managed
by the IoC Container.

CONSTRUCTOR-BASED DEPENDENCY INJECTION
- simply build your constructor with it's required args.
- and in beans.xml, add the internal tag "<constructor-arg ref=" with ref= the bean-id of the required arg obj


SETTER-BASED DEPENDENCY INJECTION
- container will call the setters in your bean after invoking a no-args constructor (i guess this means you can't have both perhaps...??)
