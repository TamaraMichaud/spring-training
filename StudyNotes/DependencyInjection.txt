CONSTRUCTOR-BASED DEPENDENCY INJECTION
- simply build your constructor with it's required args.
- and in beans.xml, add the internal tag "<constructor-arg ref=" with ref= the bean-id of the required arg obj


SETTER-BASED DEPENDENCY INJECTION
- container will call the setters in your bean after invoking a no-args constructor (i guess this means you can't have both perhaps...??)


^^ DEPENDENCY INJECTION BEST PRACTICES
- best to use CONSTRUCTORS for MANDATORY dependencies, SETTERS for optional
- 3 args should be the max (a larger number implies the class has too many responsibilities)


CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES!
- e.g ClassA requires an instance of ClassB through constructor injection, and ClassB requires an instance of ClassA through c.i....
- if you configure these classes to be injected into each other, the spring container will throw a "BeanCurrentlyInCreationException"
- the solution would be to swap AT Least one of the classes to setter-based injection
