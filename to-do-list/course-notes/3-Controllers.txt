Spring MVC is designed around the Dispatcher Servlet object, which serves as a "Front Controller";
it receives all of the requests for your application

Controller Classes / Annotated Controllers
We can map requests to methods in classes using @Controller.

@Controller / @RestController
annotated controllers can be completely customised.
they have flexible method signatures and do not have to extend base classes or implement specific interfaces


@RequestMapping
used to map requests to controller methods
also has specific mapping types; e.g. @GetMapping for GET requests, @PostMapping for POST requests etc

But (maybe in boot rather than mvc) you can also do:  @RequestMapping(value = "/url/path", method = RequestMethod.GET)
