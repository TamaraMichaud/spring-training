All of the following points are handled by the
    <dispatcher servlet receives request>  ** [created in WebAppInitializer.java]

1.  REQUEST from client (browser) received by servlet
2.  servlet uses Handler Mapping to determine the class/method to execute to handle the request  ** eg DemoController class
3.  this is returned to the dispatcher servlet
4.  servlet then calls the specific handler method
5.  this returns the model and view name  (not handled a model yet in the course but view eg "welcome/firstView"
6.  finds the viewResolver and calls it with the logical view name              ** eg WebConfig viewResolver()
7.  this uses prefix and suffix to return the physical file
8.  dispatcher servlet executes the file and makes the model available to the view
9.  view is rendered and returns the content back to the dispatcher servlet
10. servlet sends that content back to the client (browser)
