Maven WAR plugin
war contains web-app related resources
    builds project with "webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml" dirs/files
    web.xml can be replicated with annotations instead
(jar contains regular java resources)

WEB-INF/ contents cannot be simply publicised to the client by the container.
  however the servlet itself can access/process these files and serve up the contents
  usually .jsp/html templates/css etc
(java server pages)



Maven Cargo plugin
-> once added to the pom you will see in your Maven toolbar that you have many potential actions.
    ->cargo:run is the main one we want to use
the url to visit will be as configured in the project (i.e. for this one; "localhost:8080/to-do-list/index.html"
