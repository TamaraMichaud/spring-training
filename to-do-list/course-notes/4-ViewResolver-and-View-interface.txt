allows us to render models in a browser without forcing us to use specific view technology

- ViewResolver -> provides mapping between view names and actual views
    e.g. we could use jsp, thymeleaf etc...

- JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) is a component of Java EE and extends the JSP specs by adding a library
    of JSP annotations for common tasks like loops etc


(see WebConfig)
@Bean
public ViewResolver viewResolver(){
    // create an internal resource view resolver
    UrlBasedViewResolver viewResolver = new InternalResourceViewResolver();
    // ^^ latter == subclass of former. automatically handles JSTL (jsp tags)
    viewResolver.setPrefix(RESOLVER_PREFIX);
    viewResolver.setSuffix(RESOLVER_SUFFIX);

    return viewResolver;
