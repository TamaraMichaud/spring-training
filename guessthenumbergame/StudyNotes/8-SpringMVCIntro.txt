Spring Web MVC is an original framework built on the Servlet API
It is designed around the "Front Controller" pattern

*** Spring MVC has a central Servlet -> DispatcherServlet
        provides a shared algorithm for request processing

DispatcherServlet expects a WebApplicationContext (extension of ApplicationContext)
    and handles requests and responses automatically

Thymeleaf is designed to work with the View element of this framework to render web pages


Model/View/Controller design pattern

Model = responsible for managing the app's data, business logic and business rules
View = outward representation of information to the user either as a web form or charts
Controller = responsible for invoking Models to perform business logic and update the View from the model output
