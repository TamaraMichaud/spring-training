* ApplicationContext parent = ApplicationEventPublisher
    which handles event publication functionality
* Event handling in the ApplicationContext is managed by the
    ApplicationEvent class and ApplicationListener interface
* Beans deployed to the container which implement the
    ApplicationListener interface will receive a notification
    every time an ApplicationEvent is published to the container
^^ standard Observer design pattern


Example 1;  see module Console, class ConsoleNumberGuess_1;
 "implements ApplicationListener" and "@Override" only
(this class is in a separate module than the actual container so make sure AppConfig has @ComponentScan declared,
 and this class is in an appropriately-named package)

Example 2; see module Console, class ConsoleNumberGuess_2;
 without "implements... ", but direct annotations instead
 NB: @EventListener(EventClassName.class) // << or @EventListener \npublic void x(EventClass){...
